A quick and dirty version of commit__ website.

## Current issues:
+ there is no actual venue map; when we have one, there are two possible solutions: make it as an image or create it with svg graphics (time consuming but beneficial)
+ Avenir Next currently is used as local font (expected rendering problems on win / linux / android?); need to use it as a webfont
+ site is not responsive (need Greg here)
+ tested only on Mac in chrome / firefox / safari
